                <h2>Act I: History</h2>
                <p>It all started five years ago. I was inexperienced but determined to build my small business. The first-ever sale of this pillow was at my second ever Christmas market. I was inexperienced and sleep deprived, it was really cold that night, temperature dipped below 10 degrees. But when I made that first sale, I was elated. Somehow that sale made all the effort worth it.

                <h2>Act II: Exposition</h2>
                <p>The Infinity pillow is a long knitted tube that is looped and connected into a pretzel shape. The inside is filled with hypoallergenic polyfill. The trick is in the shaping of it.</p>

                <p>This pillow belongs in any old space, but my favorite spot has been the bed for reading or a quick nap. I love where it belongs in my home, and I hope it does in yours as well.</p>

                <h2>Author</h2>
                <p>I am Yudon! I started knitting when I was 6 or maybe 7 years old. I was inspired by my aunt who made a tiny sweater for my doll. After two decades or so, I am still obsessed with the idea that you can pretty much make anything you want with two needles and a piece of yarn in hand. </br> <em>How powerful is that?</em>
